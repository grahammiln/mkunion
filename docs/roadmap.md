- [_] docs: document other packages in `x/` directory
- [_] docs: document typescript types generation and end-to-end typs concepts (from backend to frontend)
- [_] feature: expose functions to extract `go:tag` metadata
- [_] docs: describe philosophy of "data as resource" and how it translates to some of library concepts

## Long tern experiments and prototypes
