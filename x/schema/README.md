# Golang recursive schema
Library allows to write code that work with any type of schemas.
Regardless if those are JSON, XML, YAML, or golang structs.

Most benefits
- Union types can be deserialized into interface field

## How to convert between json <-> go
```go
data := `{"name": "John", "cars": [{"name":"Ford"}]}`
schema := schema.FromJSON(data)
nativego, err := schema.ToGo(schema)

expected := map[string]any{
    "name": "John",
    "cars": []any{
        map[string]any{
            "name": "Ford",
        },
    },
}
assert.Equal(t, expected, nativego)
```

## How to convert schema into named golang struct?
This example shows how to convert only part of schema to golang struct.
List of cars will have type `Car` when parent `Person` object will be `map[string]any`.
```go
type Car struct {
    Name string
}
nativego := schema.MustToGo(schema, WithOnlyTheseRules(
	WhenPath([]string{"cars", "[*]"}, UseStruct(Car{}))))

expected := map[string]any{
    "name": "John",
    "cars": []any{
        Car{
            Name: "Ford",
        },
    },
}
assert.Equal(t, expected, nativego)
```

## Roadmap
### V0.1.0
- [x] Json <-> Schema <-> Go (with structs mapping)
- [x] Write test with wrong type conversions
- [x] Value are split into Number(Int, Float), String, Bool, and Null
- [x] Default schema registry + mkunion make union serialization/deserialization work transperently
- [x] Support pointers *string, etc.
- [x] Support DynamoDB (FromDynamoDB, ToDynamoDB)
- [x] Support for pointer to types like *string, *int, etc.
- [x] Support for relative paths like `WhenPath([]string{"*", "ListOfCars", "Car"}, UseStruct(Car{}))`. 
      Absolute paths are without `*` at the beginning.
- [x] Support options for `ToGo` like `WithOnlyTheseRules`, `WithExtraRules`, `WithDefaultMaoDef`, etc. 
      Gives better control on how schema is converted to golang.
      It's especially important from security reasons, whey you want to allow rules only whitelisted rules, for user generated json input.
- [x] Support for `FromGo` now accepts options like `WithTransformationsFromRegistry`, etc. for similar reason as stated above

### V0.2.x
- [ ] Support json tags in golang to map field names to schema
- [ ] Add cata, ana, and hylo morphisms
- [ ] Schema registry to support collision on types
- [ ] Schema support interface for custom type setters, that don't require reflection, and mkunion can leverage them
